        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Fire Alarm InspectorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Brandon Ramirez. I am an 18 year old first year working student at the University of California Riverside. I have lived in the inland empire for the entirety of my life. Although I have moved 
        from several areas like San Bernardino to Fontana until settling in Riverside. Growing up I was in a divided home with no siblings but as I got older each piece of that home was rebuilt and I now have 4 half siblings. This is 
        important to me as I feel I have to set an example for them and also support them along the way as they get older and find their own paths. There is a significant age gap between my siblings the smallest being 13 years and
        the biggest being 17. This makes it where I have to be responsible and watch what I do and they do.<br><br>

        My major is currently mathematics but I am planning on changing it to computer engineering. My current job ties into computer engineering via coding but before I had this job I had my first one at Fedex. I worked at Fedex as a 
        package handler for four months before I decided that I needed another job. I wanted a job that would teach me new and useful material/processes. That is when I found Enko systems and applied as a low voltage systems apprentice
        In the low voltage systems I typically work with fire alarm systems but can sometimes do service for lighting and security. At Enko we are contracted currently for the Fontana and San Bernardino school districts for test and 
        inspection for their fire alarm devices. However that is not the only work we do. As I said I can also do lighting and security service which can be private work located anywhere that Enko is contacted. The current stage I am 
        at in my apprenticeship has nothing to do with my future major but further a long the line I would be doing the coding for the fire alarm panel at a site. This is essentially the brain of all the fire alarm devices in an area 
        and where they report back to when triggered into alarm.<br><br>

        I am an avid sports fan who is also highly competitive. In high school I was the Varsity Cross Country and Soccer captain and qualified for CIF in both sports. However when it comes to watching I enjoy a variety of sports ranging
        from basketball to UFC fighting. Some words that can be used to describe me include smart, helpful, kind, tall, and skinny. I work well with others and am always eager to learn and that is why I challenge myself to be good in 
        everything I do rather than focus primarily on one specific subject. Hobbies that I enjoy would be fishing, hunting, and ganming as it brings me closer to family and gives me a chance to get in the outdoors. It is something I was raised
        doing and is a lifestytle for my family. Gaming is something my family also introduced me and is an activity where I made friends and can communicate with family through as it is a similar interests for us.
